    <caption>Learn how to make homemade creamy soy milk with this easy Japanese soy milk recipe! Just 3 ingredients required for the freshest dairy free milk! (Vegan, gluten free)</caption>
<ul>
    <lh>Ingredients</lh>
    <li>200gs Soybeans</li>
    <li>3-4 cups of water
    </li>
    <li>sugar, to taste</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <lh>Steps</lh>
    <li>Rinse and soak the beans in water overnight. Drain and add it to a pot with 2 cups of water. Bring it to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to medium low and simmer for 30 minutes or until soft. Drain the beans. </li>
    <li>From here, you can make soy milk by blending 1 cup cooked beans with 1 cup of water, and some sugar to taste. Straining is optional, depending on how smooth you like your soy milk and the power of your blender. I like to divide the amount into 2 cup portions and freeze some in batches for easy removal and daily fresh soy milk. </li>
